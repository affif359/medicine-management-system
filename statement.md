---PROBLEM STATEMENT---

Medical inventory management, when conducted manually using spreadsheets, is highly susceptible to human errors. These errors include incorrect stock counts, failing to flag expired medicine in time. This lack of real-time visibility and reliance on inefficient processes results in wrong billing and potential risks to customer safety.

Targeted Solution: To develop a simple, reliable, and console-based Medicine Management System that digitizes inventory operations (Add, Delete, View, Search) to ensure data accuracy and instant retrieval for medical shop personnel.

 ---SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES---
 
Project Inclusions (Core Scope)

The system's functionality is strictly limited to the four core inventory operations provided by the main menu:

---> Adding new medicine records (stock inflow).

---> Deleting/removing existing records (stock outflow/disposal).

---> Viewing the full, current inventory list.

--->  Searching for specific items by name.

---> billing of the medicines bought

Project Exclusions (Out of Scope)

The current version does not include:

Complex features like multi-user authentication or login systems.

A User Interface where the shop personnel gives input.

Integration with external APIs or databases.

Detailed sales/billing transaction logging.

---TARGET USERS---

The primary users of this system are personnel directly responsible for handling and managing stock within a medical shop environment with proper billing system.

Medical Shop Assistants/Staff: Who perform daily tasks like checking stock, updating inventory after deliveries, and searching for medicine, create bill.

Shop Owners: Who require quick, accurate snapshots of the current inventory health.
